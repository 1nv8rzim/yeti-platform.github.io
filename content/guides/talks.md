## Jupytherton 24 - Hunting the Yeti on Jupyter

_A practical exploration of the YETI platform using notebook for Threat
Intelligence_

YETI is an open source threat intelligence platform storing data in a graph
database. It implements a REST API giving access to all stored data which can
then be reused in your hunting notebook to then build nice visualisation graph.
This short presentation will demo whatâ€™s possible to achieve with Yeti in a
notebook and highlight some nice Python libraries to play with graph data.
